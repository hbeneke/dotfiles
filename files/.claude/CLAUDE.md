# Global rules

## No AI attribution — ever, in any project

Never add any marker that an AI wrote or helped write something. Concretely:

- No `Co-Authored-By: Claude` (or any AI co-author) in commits.
- No `Claude-Session:`, session links, or `Generated with Claude Code` lines in
  commit messages, PR descriptions, issue comments, or changelogs.
- No "written by Claude / AI-generated" notes in code comments, docs, or file
  headers.

Commit bodies end with the last prose paragraph. Use trailers only when the user
asks for one (e.g. `Refs #123`).

If such a reference already exists in something being touched (an amend, a
rebase rewrite, a PR body being edited), strip it.
